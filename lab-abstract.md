# WebLogic on Azure Linux Virtual Machines Workshop

Microsoft and Oracle have partnered to provide a set of robust and up-to-date solutions for running WebLogic on Azure Linux virtual machines. These solutions and the associated guidance will allow Azure users to much more easily lift-and-shift WebLogic workloads to Azure. The solutions support simple use cases such as easily creating a single working WebLogic instance. They also support common use cases such as clustering, load-balancing as well as database connectivity. In the future the solutions will also encompass use cases such as securing WebLogic using Azure Active Directory, consolidated logging using ELK and caching using Oracle Coherence - as well as ensuring WebLogic runs well on the Azure Kubernetes Service.

This hands-on workshop will give you a firsthand taste of the use cases supported by the solutions, using a representative but simple application. At the end of the session you will be prepared to confidently start lifting and shifting WebLogic workloads to Azure.
