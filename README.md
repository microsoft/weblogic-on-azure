# Weblogic on Azure
This repository shows how to deploy a Java application to Azure using WebLogic and virtual machines. The repository hosts the demos for this [talk](abstract.md) or materials for [this](lab-abstract.md) lab. The prerequistes for the lab are [here](prerequisites.md).

For greater details on the solutions to run WebLogic on Azure virtual machines, please look [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/workloads/oracle/oracle-weblogic). There is also a slide deck on the solutions available [here](https://aka.ms/weblogic-on-azure-deck).

The basic Java EE application used throughout is in the [javaee](/javaee) folder. You should set up and explore this application on your local machine.

The scenarios demonstrated include:

* Deploying a Java application on Azure using a simple instance of WebLogic. The [simple](/simple) folder shows how this is done.
* Deploying a Java application on Azure into a load-balanced WebLogic cluster. The [cluster](/cluster) folder shows how this is done.

We recommend exploring the scenarios in the following order, but the text is written with sufficient redundancy so that you can do them in any order.

* [javaee](/javaee)
* [simple](/simple)
* [cluster](/cluster)
* [cluster with coherence](/clusterwithcoherence)

The demos use Java EE 7, Maven, Eclipse and PostgreSQL.

# FAQ
## Eclipse release 2020.9 comes with a default Maven which causes warnings thrown during deployment
It does not block anything, but you may see 'Multiple bindings found for slf4j' during deployment when using this Eclipse release. It's related to a known issue of the IDE itself: [506676 â€“ Class path contains multiple SLF4J bindings (eclipse.org)](https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=506676). And the workaround to it is installing maven separately and config to use the installed one instead of using the default one. To access the settings: 'Window->Preferences->Maven->Installations'.
